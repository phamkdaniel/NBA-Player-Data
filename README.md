# Project 3: NBA-Player-Data
## Description:
* We attempted to analyze statistics on NBA players using machine learning tools, particularly K-Means analysis. We scraped data from https://www.basketball-reference.com/ to cluster players looking at 90 different statistics. Specicifically, we used K-Means testing in Scikit-Learn to cluster players into 8 categories.
## Built With:
* Pandas
* SciKit-Learn
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Beautiful Soup
## File Brakdown:
* bref_scrape: scrapes data from baskeball-reference. com and converts datafames to csv format.
* K-Means_final.ipynb: cleans data and runs k-means analysis, producing 8 clusters of players.
* Radar_Chart.ipynb: visualizations of cluster analysis.
